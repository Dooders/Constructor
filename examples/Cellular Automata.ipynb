    "# Cellular Automata\n",
    "\n",
    "Cellular Automata are computational models consisting of a grid of cells, where each cell evolves based on predefined rules. In the context of Constructor Theory, you can model each **cell** as a substrate and the **rules** governing the evolution of the cellular automaton as tasks that constructors perform on those substrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how you can model this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Mapping Cellular Automata to Constructor Theory**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cells as Substrates**: Each cell in the grid of the cellular automaton is a substrate. The state of a cell (e.g., `alive` or `dead` in Conway's Game of Life) represents the substrate's state.\n",
    "- **Rules as Tasks**: The transition rules that determine how a cell evolves based on its neighbors can be modeled as tasks. A task in this case would change the state of a cell based on the states of neighboring cells.\n",
    "- **Constructor**: The constructor is responsible for applying the rules (tasks) to each cell in the grid. The constructor iterates through the grid, applying the rules at each time step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Example: Conway's Game of Life**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s blend Constructor Theory with **Conway’s Game of Life**, a well-known example of cellular automata.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Conway’s Game of Life:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A cell can be in one of two states: `alive` or `dead`.\n",
    "- The state of a cell at the next time step depends on the states of its 8 neighbors.\n",
    "    - **Alive** cells with fewer than 2 or more than 3 live neighbors die.\n",
    "    - **Dead** cells with exactly 3 live neighbors become alive.\n",
    "\n",
    "We’ll model this using your Constructor Theory library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Step 1: Define the Cell as a Substrate**\n",
    "\n",
    "Each cell in the grid can be a substrate, with its state either `alive` or `dead`."
