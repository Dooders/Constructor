# Substrate

In Constructor Theory, substrates are the physical systems or entities upon which tasks are performed. Substrates can be thought of as the "materials" that constructors work on to produce specific transformations. The role of substrates in Constructor Theory is crucial because they are the objects that undergo change when a task is performed.

## **Key Concepts Related to Substrates:**

1. **State of the Substrate:**
   - A substrate has a state, which represents its current condition or configuration. For example, the state of a substrate could be "unsharpened" or "sharpened" in the case of a knife. The state can also be more complex, involving multiple parameters or dimensions (e.g., position, velocity, energy level).

2. **State Transitions:**
   - When a constructor performs a task on a substrate, it causes a state transition. This transition is the change from one state to another, as defined by the task. For instance, a sharpening task would transition the state of a knife from "unsharpened" to "sharpened."

3. **Possible and Impossible Tasks:**
   - Whether a task can be performed on a substrate depends on the substrate's initial state and the nature of the task. Some tasks may be impossible for a given substrate due to its properties or constraints, while others are possible under the right conditions.

4. **Substrate Properties:**
   - Beyond its state, a substrate may have other properties, such as temperature, pressure, or structural composition. These properties can influence whether a task can be performed. For example, a substrate might need to be at a certain temperature for a chemical reaction (task) to occur.

5. **Complex Substrates:**
   - In more advanced scenarios, substrates can be complex systems with multiple interacting components or states. For instance, a biological cell could be modeled as a substrate with states representing different stages of cellular processes, and tasks could represent biochemical reactions.

6. **Substrates and Conservation Laws:**
   - Constructor Theory often considers principles like conservation laws (e.g., conservation of energy, momentum) when determining whether a task is possible. The substrate must adhere to these principles during any state transition caused by a constructor.

## **Substrates in Practice:**

- **Example in Chemistry:**
  - In a chemical reaction, the substrate might be a molecule in a specific state (e.g., bonded or unbonded). A constructor (e.g., a catalyst) facilitates a reaction that changes the molecule’s state (e.g., breaking or forming bonds).

- **Example in Biology:**
  - In a biological system, a substrate could be an enzyme’s active site. The task could involve converting a substrate molecule into a product molecule, changing the substrate's state.

- **Example in Information Theory:**
  - In a computational system, the substrate might be a memory unit in a particular state (e.g., storing a binary 0 or 1). The task could involve writing a new value, thus changing the state of the substrate.
